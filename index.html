                        <p class="text-success text-left">Clay making encourages out-of-the-box thinking and enables children to explore their creative side. This right brained tactile activity enables children to develop their fine motor skills and 3-D visualisation ability. It is fun and encourages creative movement in children. Through clay modelling, children harness their ability to create. In attending regular pottery making sessions, the child will develop a stronger attention span and be able to focus and concentrate better as well as persevere in completing their project from beginning to end. The pottery curriculum is unique as it breaks the paradigm of traditional pottery making to focus on creativity-development and learning outcomes.</p>

Regardless of ability, the Volleyball sessions are designed to be recreational and instructive. The aim is to foster a sense of enjoyment with the sport that will keep students engaged and intrigued to discover more, whilst also introducing and developing the fundamental techniques required to become proficient in the sport of Volleyball. The coaches will use a series of drills to train skills ranging from throwing and catching, to handset, passing, spiking, and service. They will then use games to reinforce the knowledge the students have been gaining, and to spark the competitive appetites that will drive them to new heights</p>
